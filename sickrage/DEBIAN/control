Description: internet PVR for newsgroup users
 Sick Beard is a PVR for newsgroup users (with limited
 torrent support). It watches for new episodes of your
 favorite shows and when they are posted it downloads
 them, sorts and renames them, and optionally generates
 metadata for them. It currently supports NZBs.org,
 NZBMatrix, NZBs'R'Us, Bin-Req.com, Newzbin, NZB.su,
 and EZRSS and retrieves show information from
 theTVDB.com and TVRage.com.
